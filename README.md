List of components and their functionalities:
1.ProductList.js:
Objective:
The ProductList.js component is responsible for fetching and displaying a list of products. It serves as the central component for managing product data and rendering product cards dynamically.

Description:
Fetches product data: On component mount, it retrieves product data from an external API (catalogue.json).
Manages state: It maintains two states:
products: Stores the complete product list.
filteredProducts: Holds the filtered version of the products for dynamic updates.
Renders product cards: Iterates over filteredProducts and passes each product as a prop to the ProductCard component for display.
This component is essential for dynamically loading and displaying product details within the shopping interface. üöÄ

Objective:
The ProductCard.js component is responsible for displaying individual product details and allowing users to add products to the cart while ensuring stock limitations are enforced.

Description:
Displays product details: Renders the product image, name, and price.
Checks cart status: Retrieves cart data from the CartContext and checks if the product is already in the cart.
Handles stock limitations:
If the product is out of stock (quantity === 0), the "Add to Cart" button is disabled and shows "Out of Stock".
If the product is in stock, the button dynamically updates to show the current quantity of the product in the cart.
Adds product to cart: Calls the addToCart function from the CartContext when the button is clicked.
This component ensures a smooth user experience by preventing over-purchasing and providing real-time cart updates. üõí‚ú®
